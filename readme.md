dotfiles
==========
Some dotfiles that I use. Check out http://dotfiles.github.io/ for a more comprehensive dotfiles setup.

ToDo
* Move backups to a bash_backups directory
* Look into other tricks from github dotfiles
* Add an argument to the setup_dotfiles.sh that will change the main prompt based on the environment. So a server prompt will be purple or red based on a command line argument passed into the setup file.
